One proposed mechanism is direct transfer of energy to the internal wave field in the ocean interior, via eddy-induced straining and shearing of pre-existing internal waves. The magnitude, vertical structure and temporal variability of the rate of energy transfer between eddies and internal waves is quantified from a 14-month deployment of a mooring cluster in the Scotia Sea. Velocity and buoyancy observations are decomposed into wave and eddy components, and the energy transfer is estimated using the Reynolds-averaged energy equation. We find that eddies gain energy from the internal wave field at a rate of –2.2±0.6mW m−2, integrated from the bottom to 566 m below the surface. This result can be decomposed into a positive (eddy to wave) component, equal to 0.2±0.1 mW m−2, driven by horizontal straining of internal waves, and a negative (wave to eddy) component, equal to –2.5±0.6 mW m−2, driven by vertical shearing of the wave spectrum. Temporal variability of the transfer rate is much greater than the mean value. Close to topography, large energy transfers are associated with low-frequency buoyancy fluxes, the underpinning physics of which do not conform to linear wave dynamics and are thereby in need of further research. Our work suggests that eddy-internal wave interactions may play a significant role in the energy balance of the Southern Ocean mesoscale eddy and internal wave fields.","tags":[],"title":"Observed eddy-internal wave interactions in the Southern Ocean","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Glenn Carter","Gunnar Voet","Matthew Alford","James Girton","John Mickett","Jody Klymak","Larry Pratt","Kelly Pearson-Potts","Jesse Cusack","Shuwen Tan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"442f127c36c8ea4a392b536d93ada246","permalink":"/publication/carter-2019/","publishdate":"2020-01-24T21:26:27.584056Z","relpermalink":"/publication/carter-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A Spatial Geography of Abyssal Turbulent Mixing in the Samoan Passage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James Girton","John Mickett","Zhongxiang Zhao","Matthew Alford","Gunnar Voet","Jesse Cusack","Glenn Carter","Kelly Pearson-Potts","Larry Pratt","Shuwen Tan","Jody Klymak"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"9546a9302374784452d56328eb4d04e8","permalink":"/publication/girton-2019/","publishdate":"2020-01-24T21:26:27.583243Z","relpermalink":"/publication/girton-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Flow-Topography Interactions in the Samoan Passage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jesse M.

Thorpe-scale-based estimates of dissipation from moored profilers deployed on top of two sills for 17 months reveal that turbulence is continuously generated in the passage. Overturns were observed in a density band in which the Richardson number was often smaller than ¼, consistent with shear instability occurring at the upper interface of the fast-flowing bottom water layer. The magnitude of dissipation was found to be stable on long time scales from weeks to months. A second array of 12 moored profilers deployed for a shorter duration but profiling at higher frequency was able to resolve variability in dissipation on time scales from days to hours. At some mooring locations, near-inertial and tidal modulation of the dissipation rate was observed. However, the modulation was not spatially coherent across the passage. The magnitude and vertical structure of dissipation from observations at one of the major sills is compared with an idealized 2D numerical simulation that includes a barotropic tidal forcing. Depth-integrated dissipation rates agree between model and observations to within a factor of 3. The tide has a negligible effect on the mean dissipation. These observations reinforce the notion that the Samoan Passage is an important mixing hot spot in the global ocean where waters are being transformed continuously.","tags":null,"title":"Persistent Turbulence in the Samoan Passage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jesse M.

Two EM-APEX profiling floats deployed in the Drake Passage during the Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing Experiment (DIMES) independently measured a 120 ± 20-m vertical amplitude lee wave over the Shackleton Fracture Zone. A model for steady EM-APEX motion is developed to calculate absolute vertical water velocity, augmenting the horizontal velocity measurements made by the floats. The wave exhibits fluctuations in all three velocity components of over 15 cm s-1 and an intrinsic frequency close to the local buoyancy frequency. The wave is observed to transport energy and horizontal momentum vertically at respective peak rates of 1.3 ± 0.2 W m-2 and 8 ± 1 N m-2. The rate of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation is estimated using both Thorpe scales and a method that isolates high-frequency vertical kinetic energy and is found to be enhanced within the wave to values of order 10-7 W kg-1. The observed vertical flux of energy is significantly larger than expected from idealized numerical simulations and also larger than observed depth-integrated dissipation rates. These results provide the first unambiguous observation of a lee wave in the Southern Ocean with simultaneous measurements of its energetics and dynamics.","tags":["In situ oceanic observations","Internal waves","Mountain waves","Profilers","oceanic","Southern Ocean","Turbulence"],"title":"Observation of a large Lee wave in the Drake Passage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.
